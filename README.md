# Simple Hyprland üåü 
Welcome to the Simple Hyprland Guide! This repository is designed to help users set up a minimal Hyprland environment on Arch Linux. Although various scripts and configuration files are available elsewhere, they often result in bloated systems with many unused themes and configurations. This guide aims to provide a clear, concise, and minimal setup, allowing users to understand each step and customize their environment to their liking.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a clean and functional Hyprland setup like this:

## Purpose ‚ú®
This guide is intended for:

**Newcomers transitioning to Hyprland who want to gain knowledge.** üëã If you're new to Hyprland and looking to understand the ins and outs of setting it up, this guide will take you through the process step-by-step, explaining each component along the way.

**Users who wish to set up a minimal system their way, knowing what's happening at each step.**  üß† Rather than relying on scripts that automate the process, this guide empowers you to build your Hyprland environment from the ground up, enabling you to customize and tweak every aspect according to your preferences.

**Individuals looking to save time by following a structured and efficient setup process.** ‚è±Ô∏è While many guides and resources are available, they can be scattered and overwhelming. This guide consolidates the essential steps into a streamlined workflow, helping you get up and running with Hyprland quickly and efficiently.

## Getting Started üöÄ
If you're new to this guide, you can start from the [Prerequisites section](docs/prerequisites.md). This document outlines the necessary tools, packages, and assumptions required for a smooth installation and setup process.

## Documentation üìö
1. [Prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md)
2. [Core Installation](docs/installation_Hypr.md)
3. [Basic Configuration](docs/basic_configuration.md)
4. [Useful Utilities](docs/useful_utilities.md)
5. [Theming](docs/theming.md)
6. [Summary](docs/final.md)

## Compatibility ‚öôÔ∏è
While this guide is created with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) in mind, it can also be helpful for users of other distributions who are familiar with their package management and system tweaking.

## Quick Installation Script üöÄ

1. Clone the repository to your home folder:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gaurav210233/simple-hyprland.git ~/simple-hyprland
    ```
2. Navigate to the installer directory:
    ```
    cd ~/simple-hyprland/scripts/installer
    ```
3. Run the installation script with sudo:
    ```
    sudo sh install.sh
    ```
#### Important Notes:

- This script is user-centric and allows you to choose which components to install (Everything is asked, even for the core).
- While the script offers flexibility, it is recommend to installing all components for the best experience, as this is already a minimal setup.
- The installation process follows the same flow as the documentation, ensuring a structured and educational approach.
- Although designed for Arch Linux, users of Arch-based distributions may also find this script helpful.

> **Note for Newcomers**: Although this script enables rapid setup, it's highly recommended to read through the documentation for those new to Hyprland. Understanding each step will greatly enhance your ability to customize and troubleshoot your environment.
